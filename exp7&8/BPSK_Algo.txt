Algorithm:

(Modulation)

Procedure followed to obtain the BPSK signal is as follows:
1) Define the transmitted signal
-Variables to be defined are:- number of bits, size of transmitted signal, 
binary signal 0 or 1 as message to be transmitted, bit period (second).

2) Represent the input signal as digital signal
-If input signal is 1 append in an array
else if input signal is 0 append in array
-Define time of the signal in MATLAB
-Plot the transmitting signal

3) Define BPSK modulation
-Declare amplitude of carrier signal
-Declare carrier frequecncies for bit 1 
-Declare carrier phase for 1 and 0 respectively
-If input signal is 1 add carrier phase with carrier signal and append in an array 
else if input signal is 0 add carrier phase with carrier signal and append in array
-Plot modulated signal

4) Transmit Signal

(Demodulation)

1) Receive signal with/without noise

2) Define BPSK demodulation
-Define carrier signal as earlier
-Multiply received signal with carrier signal
-Integrate the received signal with lower frequecy i.e pass signal through LPF
-Define logic level 1 or 0 depending upon the output amplitude
-If received amplitude is greater than average amplitude then logic 1 
else if received amplitude is less than average amplitude then logic 0 
-As phase change of 90 was introduced for each bit, 
the signals either add or cancel each other out
-Append solution in array 

3) Represent output signal as digital signal
-Define received signal as array
-Plot received signal

4) End of demodulation
