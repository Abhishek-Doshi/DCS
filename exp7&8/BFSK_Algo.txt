Algorithm:

(Modulation)

Procedure followed to obtain the BfSK signal is as follows:
1) Define the transmitted signal
-Variables to be defined are:- number of bits, size of transmitted signal, 
binary signal 0 or 1 as message to be transmitted, bit period (second).

2) Represent the input signal as digital signal
-If input signal is 1 append in an array
else if input signal is 0 append in array
-Define time of the signal in MATLAB
-Plot the transmitting signal

3) Define BFSK modulation
-Declare amplitude of carrier signal
-Declare carrier frequecncies for bit 1 and 0 
-If input signal is 1 multiply with carrier signal frequency-1 and append in an array 
else if input signal is 0 multiply with carrier signal frequency-2 append in array
-Plot modulated signal

4) Transmit Signal

(Demodulation)

1) Receive signal with/without noise

2) Define BFSK demodulation
-Define carrier signal as earlier with respective frequencies 
-Multiply received signal with carrier signal for both frequencies
-Integrate the received signal with frequecies 1 & 2 i.e pass signal through LPF 
of frequencies 1 & 2 
-Define logic level 1 or 0 depending upon the output amplitude by subrating 
the amplitude for received signal of frequecy 2 from frequecy 1  
OR If received amplitude is greater than half of carrier signal amplitude 
of frequency 1 then logic 1 
 else if received amplitude is greater than half of carrier signal amplitude 
of frequency 2 then logic 0 

3) Represent output signal as digital signal
-Define received signal as array
-Plot received signal

4) End of demodulation
